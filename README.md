# Fragrance Recommender

## Overview
Basenotes.net is an online guide to fragrances with a database of over 20,000 fragrances and over 90,000 user reviews. Building a fragrance recommender system with data from the user reviews could help Basenotes.net improve product recommendations and provide additional insight on their customer base and most popular fragrances and brands. The recommender system could be used for strategic marketing and decisions on affiliate links and advertisements that could increase click rates and revenue.
